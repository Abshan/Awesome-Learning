# Awesome-Learning
Final year individual project, a gesture-based learning website for students to answer and control questionnaires using hand gestures was built to improve the interactivity between the user and the lessons provided in online learning websites. The frontend of the website was built using DHTML and as for the backend of the website mainly JavaScript was used. Tensorflow.js, Python with Keras and AWS services (S3, Aurora) were used to implement the gesture features on the website.
